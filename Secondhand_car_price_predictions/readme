🚀 Excited to Share My Recent Microproject in Data Science and Machine Learning! 🎯

As part of my learning journey, I completed a microproject where I analyzed real-world datasets and built a Linear Regression model to predict the second-hand cost of cars. This hands-on project helped me strengthen my skills in both data science and machine learning concepts.

🌟 Key Highlights of the Project:
📊 Data Analysis & Cleaning: Preprocessed data to ensure high-quality input for the machine learning model.
📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used visualization techniques to understand the factors affecting car prices, such as age, mileage, brand, and engine type.
🧠 Machine Learning Model: Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on key features, achieving meaningful results.
⚙️ Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and fine-tuned the model to improve accuracy.
🛠️ Python Tools Used: Leveraged libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
🔍 Outcome:
The project provided actionable insights into how various features influence car prices, showcasing the power of predictive modeling in solving real-world problems.

💡 This microproject was a fantastic learning experience, combining data manipulation, EDA, and machine learning techniques. I'm eager to explore more advanced models and expand my expertise in predictive analytics!

💬 I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions for further improvement.
